# VR-Industrial-Control-Room
For the B-Sides Calgary Cyber Security conference, I created a Virtual Reality experience that transported people into an industrial control room  environment. The goal of VR demo was to raise awareness around the challenges we face with industrial cyber security by playing a game of whats wrong with this picture. We asked people to explore the environment and identify 3 cyber security related issues in the industrial control room. A blue circle appears when the user is looking directly at one of the cyber security issues.   Most people were able to identify the issues within a few minutes and gave us an opportunity to talk about the cyber security challenges most operating assets face today.
